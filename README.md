### 1. Case of Two Distinct Real Roots

- **Test Case 1:**
  - **Input:** \( a = 1, b = -3, c = 2 \)
  - **Expected Output:** Roots are \( x_1 = 2 \), \( x_2 = 1 \)

### 2. Case of Repeated Real Root

- **Test Case 2:**
  - **Input:** \( a = 1, b = -2, c = 1 \)
  - **Expected Output:** Repeated root is \( x_1 = x_2 = 1 \)

### 3. Case with Complex Roots

- **Test Case 3:**
  - **Input:** \( a = 1, b = 2, c = 5 \)
  - **Expected Output:** No real roots (Complex roots: \( x = -1 + 2i \) and \( x = -1 - 2i \))

### 4. Case Where \( a = 0 \) (Linear Equation)

- **Test Case 4:**
  - **Input:** \( a = 0, b = 2, c = -4 \)
  - **Expected Output:** Root is \( x = 2 \) (This is a linear equation, not quadratic)

### 5. Case Where All Coefficients Are Zero

- **Test Case 5:**
  - **Input:** \( a = 0, b = 0, c = 0 \)
  - **Expected Output:** Infinite number of solutions (All values of \( x \) are solutions)

### 6. Case with \( a \neq 0 \) and \( b = 0 \)

- **Test Case 6:**
  - **Input:** \( a = 1, b = 0, c = 0 \)
  - **Expected Output:** Root is \( x = 0 \)

### 7. Case Where Discriminant is Zero

- **Test Case 7:**
  - **Input:** \( a = 1, b = 2, c = 1 \)
  - **Expected Output:** Repeated root is \( x = -1 \)

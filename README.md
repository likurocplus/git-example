### 1. The case of two actual analysis experiences

- **Test case 1:**
  - **Input:** \( a = 1, b = -3, c = 2 \)
  - **Expected:** The answer is \( x_1 = 2 \), \( x_2 = 1 \)

### 2. Case of dual experience (single real experience)

- **Test case 2:**
  - **Input:** \( a = 1, b = -2, c = 1 \)
  - **Expected result:** Double answer is \( x_1 = x_2 = 1 \)

### 3. Rational method without experience

- **Test case 3:**
  - **Input:** \( a = 1, b = 2, c = 5 \)
  - **Expected output:** No experience (complex test)

### 4. The case where the number a is 0 (not a level 2 method)

- **Test case 4:**
  - **Input:** \( a = 0, b = 2, c = -4 \)
  - **Expected output:** Answer is \( x = 2 \) (top level method)

### 5. The case where all numbers are 0

- **Test case 5:**
  - **Input:** \( a = 0, b = 0, c = 0 \)
  - **Expected output:** Infinite number of experiences (all values ​​of x are experiences)

### 6. Rational method without experience

- **Test case 6:**
  - **Input:** \( a = 1, b = 0, c = 0 \)
  - **Expected output:** The answer is \( x = 0 \) (but note if b and c are different from 0, the method may not be available)

### 7. In case the number is negative

- **Test case 7:**
  - **Input:** \( a = 1, b = 2, c = 1 \)
  - **Expected result:** The result is \( x = -1 \)
